##  Project Structure
From the last time we presented there have been a lot of changes done to both the godot code and the c++, but mainly they can be sumamrized with:

- Added pictures for portratits and features for each resident
- Added background pictures to each scene
- Create different scenes for the investigating the residents with difefrent buttons that only work wheneber news has talked about the new hints for zombies
- Created new c++ fucntion in game_manager to adjust this changes
- We were able to update the days and token on screen after each day passed, and after the user either killed or inspected a resident
- We created the pictures for each scene and character
- We added new questions and tried to made them so the answers would be different each time
